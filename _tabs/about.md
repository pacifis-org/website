Congratulations, you found Pacifis!

First of all, welcome! I'm CarlosGDCJ, the author, and on this website you'll find texts in computer science about topics that I enjoy.
Currently, expect articles related to machine learning. If things change in the future, hopefully I'll remember to update this page.

Feel free to stay as long as you want. See you around!
