This is the meta entry to the Road to Grandmaster series.
Here I will briefly explain what Kaggle is and what I hope to achieve.

## Kaggle
Kaggle is a platform for data science and machine learning where people can upload datasets, work on these datasets, and participate in discussions and competitions.

The platform has 5 performance tiers (Novice, Contributor, Expert, Master, and Grandmaster), and moving all the way to the last one [takes literally years](https://www.kaggle.com/code/priteshshrivastava/how-long-does-it-take-to-become-a-kaggle-expert/notebook), assuming you are an ordinary person (which I am).
To advance, you basically need to collect a bunch of medals and upvotes (more details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/progression)), and that takes a long time.

## Approach
Although there is *Grandmaster* written in the title, I don't plan on trying to reach that tier as fast as possible.
The destination is the highlight, but the value is on the journey.
The main focus here will be on improvement, so if medals and upvotes come, they will come as a side effect.
The aim is for this RTG to be organicâ€”no need to rush.

In essence, this series is nothing more than "using Kaggle to improve my data science skills", so you can expect RTGs to involve pretty much anything related to the field.

As we are in it for the long run, I'll likely gravitate towards the themes I'm most interested in, but I'll also try something completely different every now and again.

Let's see where this road takes us. See you around!
